abstract: "The paper proposes a strategy for understanding metaphysical grounding in deflationary terms and, more generally, proposes a form of methodological deflationism with respect to the notions of ground. The idea is to define a deflationary *is grounded in*-predicate by appeal to the two-place non-causal connective 'because' and a deflationary truth predicate. To this end we discuss the explanatory role of the truth-predicate in non-causal explanations and develop a theory of truth for the language of the 'because'-connective. We argue that at least from a logical perspective our deflationary notion of ground is up to the task."
