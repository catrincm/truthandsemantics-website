I work mostly in philosophical logic, metaphysics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mathematics. I have a particular interest in deflationism, truth, properties, classes, numbers, the semantic and logical paradoxes, metaontology, theories of meaning, and logicism

Before starting in Bristol, I had a Marie-Curie project on 'The logical function of property talk'. I was also a main researcher on the DFG funded project 'Reference patterns of paradox'.
