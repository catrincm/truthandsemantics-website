summary: "We explore some possible answers to the question of how the intuitive, natural language notion of truth is connected to the theoretical notion of truth at play in truth-conditional semantics."
abstract:  "According to a prominent idea, to know the meaning of a sentence is to know the conditions under which a sentence is true. Arguably this idea underlies the nowadays predominant semantic framework: so-called truth conditional semantics. Truth-conditional semantics aims to provide systematic truth-conditions for sentences in a compositional way. As a matter of fact these truth-conditions are usually formulated in an artificial, formal language using a theoretical notion of truth. But this raises the question to what extent this formal enterprise is warranted by the initial, intuitive idea. In other word, it raises the question of how the intuitive, natural language notion of truth is connected to the theoretical notion of truth at play in truth-conditional semantics. In this talk we explore some possible answers to this question and discuss their challenges."
