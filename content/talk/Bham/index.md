summary: "We discuss and develop a semantics for the truth predicate in belief contexts."
abstract: "The notions of belief and truth frequently interact in philosophical discourse but, surprisingly, a coherent semantics for such discourse is still wanting. Indeed, a number of puzzles stand in way of a satisfactory semantic account of the notion of truth in doxastic and epistemic contexts. In this talk I will discuss these puzzles and then sketch a semantic account that combines ideas from contextualist theories of attitude reports and Awareness semantics for non-idealized belief."
