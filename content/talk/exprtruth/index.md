title: "Simple Conditionals in Fixed-Point Semantics"
event: Workshop on Truth In Expressively Rich Languages
#event_url: with Carlo Nicolai

location: Bristol
#address:
  #street: 450 Serra Mall
  #city: Stanford
  #region: CA
  #postcode: '94305'
  #country: United States

summary: "We investigate conditionals in Kripke-style theories of truth and propose attractive truth-conditions for a variably-strict conditional that lead to a monotone evaluation scheme. As a consequence, the Kripke jump associated with the evaluation scheme will have fixed points."
