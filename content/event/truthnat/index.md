summary: "The aim of the conference is to explore  the semantics and pragmatics of the word ‘true’ in natural language. Central topics of discussion will include whether or not ‘true’ is ambiguous, context sensitive, vague, gradable, presuppositional, or lacking content altogether. Other relevant topics will include what sort of property or concept ‘true’ expresses, connections between natural language ‘true’ and the semantic paradoxes, and syntactic properties of ‘true’."

The workshop is hosted by the ERC-Starting Grant ['Truth and Semantics' (TRUST 803684)](/) at the University of Bristol directed by Johannes Stern. It's aim is to explore  the semantics and pragmatics of the word ‘true’ in natural language. Central topics of discussion will include whether or not ‘true’ is ambiguous, context sensitive, vague, gradable, presuppositional, or lacking content altogether. Other relevant topics will include what sort of property or concept ‘true’ expresses, connections between natural language ‘true’ and the semantic paradoxes, and syntactic properties of ‘true’.

### Abstracts:

#### Dorit Bar-On (University of Connecticut): Truth in Meaning.
With the so-called linguistic turn in philosophy, it has become standard to try to “save the differences” amongst different types of discourses (e.g. ethical, mathematical, epistemological) by positing semantic differences – differences in kinds of meaning, or else in kinds of truth. Such semantic strategies face a dual challenge. If the semantic differences are too deep, it becomes difficult to account for palpable logico-semantic continuities across discourses, as well as the meaning/truth of ‘mixed’ sentences or arguments. If one addresses this challenge by positing a new type of uniform meaning or truth that all sentences possess, then one must face anew the challenge of saving the differences. Using first-person discourse as a case study, I argue that we should resist trying to capture differences across discourses by resorting to pluralism about meaning or truth. We should capture logico-semantic continuities by assigning indicative sentences from all discourses truth-conditions as their meanings. I offer a particular construal of the appropriate notion of truth-conditions and explain how it leaves room for saving the differences not semantically but rather in other (e.g. metaphysical, epistemological) terms.

#### Caspar Wilson (King's College London): Austin's Alethic Pluralism and a Pragmatic Function of ‘True’.
In this paper, I compare J.L. Austin sustained discussion of the “highly exceptional” word ‘real’ in Sense and Sensibilia with various things he says about ‘truth’: “that ‘true’ is just such another extraordinary word is obvious.” Although there is no reason to think extraordinary words must all be so for similar reasons, from this comparison emerges a reading of Austin as a peculiar sort of alethic pluralist, one where, in calling something true, one can say any of indefinitely many things depending on the appropriate standards of the occasion. Whether or not Austin’s brand of alethic pluralism has the virtues that motivates other versions, it avoids Tappolet’s mixed inference challenge, and hence plausibly lacks one of their vices.
Moreover, this reading identifies an additional function of ‘true’. Miscommunication can occur when speakers disagree over the appropriate standards an occasion calls for. A use of ‘true’ can either clarify whether that is the sort of fit between words and the world at play, or to attempt to impose more stringent standards.   

#### Keith Simmons (University of Connecticut): ‘True’: Paradox and Context.
I argue for two claims about the predicate ‘true’: first, that ‘true’ is a context-sensitive predicate, and second, that ‘true’ applies almost everywhere except for certain singular points where its application breaks down. The claim about context-sensitivity is supported by an examination of our reasoning with liar sentences, sentences which say of themselves that they are not true. The ‘singularity’ claim accommodates the expressive power of natural language, and is inspired by a remark of Gödel’s, that the paradoxes are analogous to dividing by zero. These two claims are extended to the semantic terms ‘denotes’, ‘extension’, and ‘valid’, each of which, like ‘true’, is associated with paradox. My overall aim is an account of semantic paradox that endorses the substantiveness of our semantic notions, and respects Tarski’s intuition that natural languages are universal.  

#### Ethan Landes (University of Zürich): How Does “True” Modify Dual Character Concepts?
The adjective “true” can felicitously modify some social kinds but not others. For example, “true artist” and “true scientist” seems to pick out particularly devoted artists and scientists, but experimental evidence has shown people generally judge “true optician” or “true cashier” to be infelicitous. It has been hypothesized that categories like artist and scientist differ from categories like cashier or optician in that while both sets of categories have descriptive content, so-called Dual Character Concepts like artist and cashier have independent normative dimensions associated with idealized values. In other words, you can be an artist by merely having certain commitments to art or beauty, but you cannot be a cashier by merely having certain commitments to the exchange of money or customer service.
Despite the importance of the true-modifier in philosophical and psychological discussion of Dual Character concepts, the mechanism by which “true” modifies Dual Character Concepts has not been explored. Through a series of experiments, we first verify that “true” does indeed modulate certain social kind terms to normative, or value-laden, readings. We then demonstrate that while people’s default reading of Dual Character Concepts like “scientist” or “artist” is specifically descriptive and not normative, it is very easy to get people to read Dual Character Concept terms normatively. We hypothesize that “true” as well as the other mechanisms work by raising the salience of certain norms about the values associated with social kinds.
