summary: "The conference has two principal aims: The first aim is to investigate the role various forms of truthmaking semantics and semantical grounding can play in diagnosing the problematic nature of paradoxes (including, but not limited to, the semantic paradoxes and the paradoxes of vagueness), and the solutions to these paradoxes truthmaking semantics and semantical grounding ogive rise to. The second aim is to study the paradoxes of truthmaking and semantic grounding."
