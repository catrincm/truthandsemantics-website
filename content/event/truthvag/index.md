The conference is hosted by the ERC-Starting Grant ['Truth and Semantics' (TRUST 803684)](/) at the University of Bristol directed by Johannes Stern. It centers around two themes: truth and indeterminacy/vagueness (broadly construed). We investigate paradoxes related to these notions, non-classical logics or semantic frameworks that have been proposed for handling them, as well as the interconnections between theories of truth and theories of indeterminacy.
