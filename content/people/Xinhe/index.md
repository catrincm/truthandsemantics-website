summary: "
    I recently earned my PhD in philosophy from MIT. Before that, I studied as an undergraduate at the University of Notre Dame, double majoring in philosophy and mathematics. ​​I work primarily on philosophical logic, mathematical logic, metaphysics, and the philosophy of language. I'm especially interested in Boolean-valued models, vagueness and indeterminacy, semantic paradoxes, set theory, formal theories of truth, and truthmaker semantics.
